We understand that adopting a CRM can be daunting, especially for small businesses with limited IT resources. That’s why Act! goes the extra mile to support our customers. Every account – no matter the size – is assigned a dedicated Account Manager, a real person who’s committed to your success from onboarding onward.

Among the hundreds of thousands of businesses that use Act! daily, many share a common challenge: knowing that sales and marketing are crucial for growth, but struggling to focus on them due to limited resources. Act! is here to fill that gap, providing the tools you need to succeed, without the complexity you don’t.

Take the story of SmartVentilation, a long-time customer providing environmental remediation services. With Act!’s help, owner Wayne Dean was able to set up large-scale marketing campaigns with ease, uncovering new prospects and expanding his business.
