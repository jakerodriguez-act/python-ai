### Customers love our award-winning software!



 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 






 





“What I love about Custom Tables is that it’s a way of grouping and searching and being able to sort unique data as well as report on it. And, Custom Tables can be extended into Act! Marketing Automation so you can create a group from it and easily send out marketing communications.”

Debora Boyle  

Act! Certified Consultant, President, Action Platinum Solutions






 





“I can build a group or a filter right out of Custom Tables and then develop a marketing piece for a trade-in opportunity, a new product that’s coming out, or notify customers about a service issue and send that to a particular group of customers using Custom Tables. I think it’s huge. And it’s probably one of the best things about Act.”

Greg Sprunk
