Before you invest in a particular system, it\u2019s important to be clear about your priorities, IT competence, and budget right from the start. Our free CRM guide will help you find the right CRM product for your business. \n\n\n[Download the Guide](/guides/best-crm-software/)\n\n\n\n\n\n![Act! CRM Trial Image](https://www.act.com/wp-content/themes/act-crm/assets/images/splash1.png)\n\n![Act! CRM Trial Image](https://www.act.com/wp-content/themes/act-crm/assets/images/splash2.png)\n\n![](https://www.act.com/wp-content/uploads/cta-crm-icon-2.webp) \n\n\n\n### Why is CRM important?\n\nThe customer base of a business is one of its biggest assets, if not THE biggest. Therefore, this asset deserves tight management and oversight, and may require a CRM as tracking and managing existing and potential customer interactions become more challenging when businesses grow. For example, at some point during your business growth, you might ask yourself: Who are my customers? What do they need? When was the last time we interacted with them? Is our sales pipeline healthy? Are customers engaging with our content?\n\nYou may find that your customers and prospects may start to wander off and that they aren\u2019t satisfied with merely a high-quality service or product. They need to feel engaged, and they want a business to give them the respect and personalized experience that makes them feel like they belong.\n\nWith CRM software, you are able to ensure that you establish long-term customer relationships by knowing every detail about your customers, including their needs, preferences and behaviors, at all times. Satisfied and engaged customers are more likely to return to your company for additional purchases and to recommend your products or services to their friends and families.\n\nNot sure if your business needs a CRM system? [Check out these ten signs you might need a CRM.](/blog/why-you-need-a-crm/)\n\n\n\nA survey conducted on Act! customers revealed that\u00a075% of users\u00a0believe that their CRM software helped them grow their business1\n\n\n\n### What are the benefits of CRM?\n\n* **Collaborate through integration:** Integrating data from different functions of a business helps you maximize effectiveness through collaboration. For example, potential customer contact details can be \u2018pushed\u2019 from lead capture forms on your website, into \u2018hot lead\u2019 action lists in your CRM solution \u2013 maximizing collaboration between marketing and sales.\n* **Manage pipeline effectively:** By being able to visualize your [sales pipelines](/products/features/pipeline-management/), you can see exactly which deal needs your immediate attention and which deal has gone stale. By periodic monitoring of deals that pass through your pipeline, you can identify areas of concern and eliminate them, ensuring a clog-free pipeline at all times. Additionally, your marketing and sales team are better connected, ensuring your sales pipeline is always filled with high-quality leads.\n* **Automate for maximum productivity:** Businesses often execute various processes every day that consist of a series of redundant tasks carried out by multiple users. A CRM system can help you automate those processes to save time and drive consistency. You can automate tasks such as scheduling follow-up activities, sending email campaigns, or assigning contacts to a new sales rep. This way, you can make sure all your team members are following the same process from start to finish, and you eliminate the need for repetitive manual work.\n* **Engage to build lasting customer relationships:** In the modern technological world, a customer expects a lot more from a company than just a reasonably-priced, high-quality product or service. They want to feel understood, and they want to have an engaging, personalized experience whenever they get in touch with the company or vice versa. A CRM captures and stores every customer\u2019s journey from the start to the very end. By knowing their preferences, you can understand their needs, and by eventually giving them what they need, you get their loyalty in return.\n* **Improve customer experience with shared information:** For example, if a customer experiences a problem with your product, multiple teams can work together to solve the issue. While your technical support team is fixing the issue, the customer service team can communicate the solution to the customer and provide further assistance. At the same time, the marketing team can adapt their messaging.\n* **Increase revenues:** A CRM helps you improve levels of customer satisfaction, and retention \u2013 happy and long-term customers entail increased revenues. It also lets you save a lot of time by automating essential business tasks and promoting collaboration between different business functions. These time savings and productivity gains enable you to lower costs. Lastly, with a CRM system, you can create targeted marketing campaigns so that you can reach out to the right people at the right time and increase sales.\n\n\n![](https://www.act.com/wp-content/uploads/6-Steps-to-Marketing-Automation-Success-Image-V2-1-1.webp \"6-Steps-to-Marketing-Automation-Success-Image-V2-1\")\n\n\n### Which business functions need a CRM system?\n\n* **Marketing:** Marketing efforts are not just about creating the perfect campaign; they are also a lot about reaching out to the right people. A CRM system paired with email marketing lets marketers divide a customer base into segments and send customized messages to every segment.Marketing teams benefit from improved lead management. Lead capture forms on your website can be integrated into your customer relationship management software and passed onto sales for follow up.Since all of the customers\u2019 activity is tracked in the software, marketing can gain valuable and real-time insights into their behavior.\n* **Sales:** With CRM technology, sales can streamline the whole [sales process](/7-step-sales-process/) and shorten the sales cycle. By visualizing the sales pipeline, your sales reps can identify new leads and the deals that require immediate attention and focus on the most valuable opportunities.They can schedule calls, follow-ups and meetings and take notes and send invoices. Additionally, you can run sales reports and sales leads forecasts to track all sales activities and review performance.\n* **Customer Service:** Using a CRM software helps you store customer preferences and track all activities associated with them. If a customer tells you that they don\u2019t want to receive weekly email updates, you can simply check a box in the CRM, and the emails will stop.You can manage and monitor any post-sale interactions in the CRM software and share important updates with sales or marketing, enabling the functions to collaborate and address potential issues and provide solutions faster.\n\n\n## Want to see a CRM system in action?\n\nTry Act! free for 14 days.

It was essentially a digital Rolodex that enabled its users to organize and store customer lifecycle information effectively.\n\nIn the 80\u2019s, a lot of the features that CRM software systems have today didn\u2019t exist yet. Act! made the development community realize the possible benefits of a software with scalability that harnesses the power of customer information to help a business manage its relationships better.\n\nAt the time, the term \u201cCRM\u201d did not exist. It was only in the 90\u2019s that people started to use it, after features like sales automation, enterprise resource planning, and marketing capabilities complemented the contact management features of the software.\n\n\n\n### Wrapping up\n\n**Here\u2019s a quick summary of what you should know about CRM**\n\n* **Definition of CRM:** CRM is an abbreviation for Customer Relationship Management and refers to software used to build and manage customer relationships.\n* **CRM software:** CRM software is a technology, which stores and organizes businesses\u2019 information about all of their customers, leads and prospects in one place.\n* **Importance of CRM:** With a CRM software, a business ensures that it establishes long-term relationships with its customers and streamlines processes to improve customer service, and drive business growth and profitability.\n* **Benefits of CRM:** Building lasting customer relationships, streamlining and automating processes, creating better collaboration and communication, better pipeline management, and increased revenues are many of the benefits of a CRM.\n* **Who needs a CRM?:** Sales, marketing, and customer service teams, as well as [small business owners](/best-crm-for-small-business/) benefit from leveraging the power of a CRM.\n* **On-premise vs. Cloud CRM:** A Cloud CRM is a CRM software that uses Cloud computing technology to host the CRM application.
